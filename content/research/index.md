## MACOI Research Line

Current Manuel’s research track is called *Managing Complexity with Computational Intelligence (MACOI)*.

MACOI focuses on applying computational intelligence techniques for solving complex real-world applications and SME needs. The set of advanced computational techniques includes metaheuristics for single and multi-objective optimization problems, machine learning, simulation, agent-based modeling, and social network analysis. The target business and engineering applications are manifold: industrial engineering, healthcare and ambient assisted solutions, marketing and brand management, food engineering, microscopy, radiotherapy for cancer, energy prediction and fire detection.

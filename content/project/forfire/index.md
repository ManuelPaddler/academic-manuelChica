title: "Forfire"
summary: "FORFIRE aims to develop an outdoors fire detection system using a new camera sensor only sensible to VUV part of the spectrum. This feature provides a set of advantages comparing with current sensors. Developing this new sensor will provide the capability of early fire detection with a very low rate of false alarm (0.1%). This can be achieved by focusing on the spectral characteristics of flames in the Vacuum Ultra Violet (VUV) area (at wavelengths between 140 to 240 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum. "
